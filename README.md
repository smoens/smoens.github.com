  My Personal Website
</h1>

This website is created with <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world">Gatsby's hello world starter template</a>. Gatsby's bootcamp by Andrew Mead was really helpful in getting started with building a personal website in Gatsby ([Gatsby JS - The Great Gatsby Bootcamp [Full Tutorial] by Andrew J Mead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM)).
